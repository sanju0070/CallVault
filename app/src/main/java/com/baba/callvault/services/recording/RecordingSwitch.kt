/**
 * Applies the user's master recording switch ([RecordingState]) and carries out the side effects of a
 * transition. The pref itself is what the arming gates read; this is only the lifecycle work around it:
 *
 * - **→ STOPPED (off):** stop the keep-alive (so its watchdog cannot relaunch what we tear down and its
 *   persistent notification goes away), then tear the daemon down — but never cut a call in progress
 *   (finish-current, apply-to-next). A reboot will not resurrect it, because [DaemonKeepAliveService.start]
 *   itself honours STOPPED.
 * - **→ ACTIVE (on):** bring the recorder back up (standalone via the keep-alive, Shizuku by binding).
 *
 * Teardown and bring-up make blocking calls, so **call this off the main thread.**
